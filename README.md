### Hi, I'm Mark üëã

I'm a senior software engineer working at [Federato](https://www.federato.ai/). While I'm not afraid of CSS, my true passion lies in JavaScript engineering and developer experience (DX). I love finding ways to simplify or improve development workflow to save time and make it more fun to work on applications. Wait, did I forget to mention how much I love TypeScript?

Outside of work, I'm a small town kid from Wisconsin who loves small town life almost as much as I like snow and winter. In my free time I like working on my house, spending time with family and friends, and playing disc golf. I am also a Christian seeking to be more like Jesus in word, thought, and deed.

While I am a software engineer and a total nerd, I'm a huge extrovert and love spending time with people. If you ever want to debate the usefulness of college education for professions like computer science, I will gladly oblige as I am a self-taught developer who found very little practical value in college behind getting that slip of paper they call a diploma.

## üî≠ Recent projects

- [termicons](https://github.com/mskelton/termicons). VS Code material icons repackaged and optimized for terminal rendering.
- [termicons.nvim](https://github.com/mskelton/termicons.nvim). Neovim companion plugin to termicons.
- [dottie](https://github.com/mskelton/dottie). After encountering some limitations of [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), I decided to write my own bash based dotfile manager. Surprisingly simple, yet very powerful.

## üå± I‚Äôm currently learning

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). I use Tailwind personally and professionally and I'm currently reading fully through the docs.
- [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13). A bit of trend-following here, but quite excited to learn more about Next 13 and ways I can use it's concepts even for projects that don't use Next.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com). My work on termicons has helped me get a little familiar with Figma, and I feel like I just stepped into a whole new world of design.
- [Luarocks](https://luarocks.org). I created a couple luarocks for termicons.nvim which proved to be an interesting learning experience into another language's package manager.
