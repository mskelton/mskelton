### Hi, I'm Mark 👋

I'm a staff software engineer working at [Ramp](https://ramp.com). I
love all things frontend whether that's building stunning UI components,
improving accessibility and user experience, or fine-tuning the frontend build
system. Developer experience is another huge passion of mine as I like to
empower myself and other engineers to build excellent solutions with less
friction. TypeScript, React, CSS, and Go are where you'll find me the happiest,
and a little Rust sprinkled here and there doesn't hurt.

Outside of work, I'm a Wisconsin native who loves small-town life
almost as much as I like snow and winter. In my free time, I like working on my
house, spending time with family and friends, and playing disc golf. My life
is dedicated to the service of Jesus and sharing the good news of the gospel
to the ends of the earth. My hope is for men and women to find in Jesus the
only true hope for this life, and the life to come.

While I am a software engineer and a total nerd, I'm a huge extrovert and love
spending time with people. If you ever want to debate the usefulness of college
education for professions like computer science, I will gladly oblige as I am a
self-taught developer who found very little practical value in college behind
getting that slip of paper they call a diploma.
