### Hi, I'm Mark 👋

I'm a software engineer and follower of Christ located in Monroe, Wisconsin. I currently work at [Nextiva](https://www.nextiva.com) as a Senior Software Engineer.

I'm a senior front-end software engineer currently working at Nextiva. While I'm not afraid of CSS, my true passion lies in JavaScript engineering and developer experience (DX). I love finding ways to simplify or improve development workflow to save time and make it more fun to work on applications. Oh yeah, and I think TypeScript is awesome. 😁

Outside of work, I'm a small town kid from Wisconsin who loves small town life almost as much as I like snow and winter. In my free time I like working on my house, spending time with my girlfriend, and playing disc golf. I am also a devout Christian seeking to be more like Jesus in word, thought, and deed.

While I am a software engineer and a total nerd, I'm a huge extrovert and love spending time with people. If you ever want to debate the usefulness of college education for professions like computer science, I will gladly oblige as I am a self-taught developer who found very little practical value in college behind getting that slip of paper they call a diploma. 🙂

## 🔭 Recent projects

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
