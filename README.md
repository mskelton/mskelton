### Hi, I'm Mark 👋

I'm a staff software engineer working at [Federato](https://federato.ai). I
love all things frontend whether that's building stunning UI components,
improving accessibility and user experience, or fine-tuning the frontend build
system. Developer experience is another huge passion of mine as I like to
empower myself and other engineers to build excellent solutions with less
friction. TypeScript, React, CSS, and Go are where you'll find me the happiest,
and a little Rust sprinkled here and there doesn't hurt.

Outside of work, I'm a small-town kid from Wisconsin who loves small-town life
almost as much as I like snow and winter. In my free time, I like working on my
house, spending time with family and friends, and playing disc golf. I am also a
Christian seeking to be more like Jesus in word, thought, and deed.

While I am a software engineer and a total nerd, I'm a huge extrovert and love
spending time with people. If you ever want to debate the usefulness of college
education for professions like computer science, I will gladly oblige as I am a
self-taught developer who found very little practical value in college behind
getting that slip of paper they call a diploma.
