### Hi, I'm Mark üëã

I'm a staff software engineer working at [Widen](https://www.widen.com), an [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) company. While I'm not afraid of CSS, my true passion lies in JavaScript engineering and developer experience (DX). I love finding ways to simplify or improve development workflow to save time and make it more fun to work on applications. Wait, did I forget to mention how much I love TypeScript?

Outside of work, I'm a small town kid from Wisconsin who loves small town life almost as much as I like snow and winter. In my free time I like working on my house, spending time with family and friends, and playing disc golf. I am also a devout Christian seeking to be more like Jesus in word, thought, and deed.

While I am a software engineer and a total nerd, I'm a huge extrovert and love spending time with people. If you ever want to debate the usefulness of college education for professions like computer science, I will gladly oblige as I am a self-taught developer who found very little practical value in college behind getting that slip of paper they call a diploma.

## üî≠ Recent projects

- [mskelton.dev](https://mskelton.dev). Recently updated my website to a new Tailwind powered theme.
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/mskelton/dotfiles). I know, dotfiles seems like an odd project, but I've been doing a lot to improve my configuration as I dive deeper into the world of Neovim and terminals.
- [dottie](https://github.com/mskelton/dottie). After encountering some limitations of [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), I decided to write my own bash based dotfile manager. Surprisingly simple, yet very powerful.

## üå± I‚Äôm currently learning

- [Golang](https://go.dev). I've been exploring the possibility of getting back into backend development, and Go is a great language I've been learning and using for various projects.
- [ZMK](https://zmk.dev). I've been using a Moonlander keyboard but recently purchased a Kenesis Advantage 360 and am digging into the ZMK firmware docs to understand how best to setup this new keyboard.
- [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13). A bit of trend-following here, but quite excited to learn more about Next 13 and ways I can use it's concepts even for projects that don't use Next.

## ‚ö° Fun facts

- The first programming language I learned was Python which I almost never use anymore. üêç
- I've had many hobbies over the years including locksmithing, Rubik's cubes, Braille, and more. üîê
- I play the Ukulele daily. üé∏
