### Hi, I'm Mark 👋

I'm a software developer and follower of Christ located in Madison, Wisconsin. I currently work at [Widen Enterprises](https://github.com/Widen) as a JavaScript Engineer.

## 🔭 Recent projects

- [Yarn 2 outdated plugin](https://github.com/mskelton/yarn-plugin-outdated) to provide similar functionality to `yarn outdated` but for Yarn 2. This was my first time writing a Yarn plugin and the docs are a little scarce so it was an interesting learning opportunity.
- I've been working on an internal project at my company for making it super easy to create Playwright selectors. I'd like to open source it eventually as I think it has some really interesting potential.
- [VS Code npm Outdated](https://github.com/mskelton/vscode-npm-outdated) extension which displays diagnostics in package.json files for outdated packages with the ability to quickly update to the latest version.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- [Go](https://golang.org). I always enjoy learning new languages and Go seemed like an easy to learn yet powerful language.
- [Forex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market). I've begun exploring the world of foreign exchange, MetaTrader 4/5, expert advisors, and more.

## ⚡ Fun facts

- The first programming language I learned was Python which I almost never use anymore. 🐍
- I'm terrible at design and yet I maintain color themes for 2 IDEs and 2 websites. 🤷
- I'm currently the youngest employee at my company at 21 years old. 👶
