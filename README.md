### Hi, I'm Mark 👋

I'm a software developer and follower of Christ located in Monroe, Wisconsin. I currently work at [Widen Enterprises](https://github.com/Widen) as a JavaScript Engineer.

## 🔭 Recent projects

- [Yarn outdated plugin](https://github.com/mskelton/yarn-plugin-outdated). I've been using this plugin for quite a while now, but recently updated it to support Yarn 3 with some neat features including lockfile aware outdated dependency checking.
- [Lariat](https://github.com/Widen/lariat) which is an open source library I've been developing for my company to reduce boilerplate when creating page objects for Playwright tests.
- [Prop Types to TS](https://github.com/mskelton/prop-types-to-ts). This tool has matured quite a lot since I first started building it in May of 2020. Most recently I've added support for JSDoc comments and fixed some pretty wild edge cases that my company actually ran into when using the tool.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- [Go](https://golang.org). I always enjoy learning new languages and Go seemed like an easy to learn yet powerful language.
- [Forex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market). I've begun exploring the world of foreign exchange, MetaTrader 4/5, expert advisors, and more.
- Ergonomics, starting with my purchase of the [Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) keyboard from ZSA. Super excited to continue to learn more about ergonomics and maintaining a healthy body while doing the things I love to do.

## ⚡ Fun facts

- The first programming language I learned was Python which I almost never use anymore. 🐍
- I dislike design and yet I maintain color themes for 2 IDEs and 2 websites. 🤷
- I'm currently the youngest employee at my company at 22 years old. 👶
