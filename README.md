### Hi, I'm Mark 👋

I'm a software developer and follower of Christ located in Monroe, Wisconsin. I currently work at [Widen Enterprises](https://github.com/Widen) as a JavaScript Engineer.

## 🔭 Recent projects

- [mskelton.dev](https://mskelton.dev). I'm finally working on putting together my own personal website. Better late than never!
- [Lariat](https://github.com/Widen/lariat). My company has adopted [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing, and Lariat is an open source library I developed for them to reduce boilerplate when creating page objects.
- [Yarn outdated plugin](https://github.com/mskelton/yarn-plugin-outdated). I've been using this plugin for quite a while now, but recently updated it to support Yarn 3 with some neat features including lockfile aware outdated dependency checking.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- [Go](https://golang.org). I always enjoy learning new languages and Go seemed like an easy to learn yet powerful language.
- [Forex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market). I've begun exploring the world of foreign exchange, MetaTrader 4/5, expert advisors, and more.
- Ergonomics, starting with my purchase of the [Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) keyboard from ZSA. Super excited to continue to learn more about ergonomics and maintaining a healthy body while doing the things I love to do.

## ⚡ Fun facts

- The first programming language I learned was Python which I almost never use anymore. 🐍
- I dislike design and yet I maintain color themes for 2 IDEs and 2 websites. 🤷
- I'm currently the youngest employee at my company at 22 years old. 👶
